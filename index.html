    <h2>Let Me Introduce Myself</h2>
    <p>Over the past 15 years, I have been a professional dancer and cheerleader. I have had the great honor of travelling across the map doing what I love; connecting with people. I have performed and taught in Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and Netherlands! During my travels, I was fortunate enough to receive hands-on experience behind the scenes. In 2016, I interned for a cheerleading company which ultimately exposed me to software engineering and developing. Since then, I have been itching to finally make a career change. I am so excited to be able to connect with people on a different level similar to my past experiences. Welcome! You are now apart of this exciting journey I have embarked on.

      <p> What most excites me about this new journey is the community and we encourage to be successful in this industry. Developers are always sharing tips, tricks, and advice to one another. There is a team enivornment that keeps me motivated and eagered to learn!.</p>
