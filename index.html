        </div>
     <p> For over the past 15 years, I have had the pleasure of travelling across the world doing what I love, connecting with other people. As a professional dancer and cheerleader, I was able to teach, learn, and bond with people. I was fortunate enough to receive hands-on experience behind the scenes. In 2016, I interned for a cheerleading company which ultimately exposed me to software engineering and developing. Since then, I have been itching to finally make a career change. I am so excited to be able to connect with people on a different level similar to my past experiences. Welcome! You are now apart of this exciting journey I have embarked on.</p>

      </ol>
      <p>What excites me about this journey is the community I will now be able to connect. Web Developers are always trading tips, tricks, and advice. I am looking forward to the team environment.</p>
