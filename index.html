    <h2>Let Me Introduce Myself</h2>
    <p>Over the past 15 years, I have been a professional dancer and cheerleader. I have had the great honor of travelling across the map doing what I love; connecting with people. I have performed and taught in Russia, Ukraine, Germany, and Netherlands! During my travels, I was fortunate enough to receive hands-on experience behind the scenes. In 2016, I interned for a cheerleading company which ultimately exposed me to software engineering and developing. Since then, I have been itching to finally make a career change. I am so excited to be able to connect with people on a different level similar to my past experiences. Welcome! You are now apart of this exciting journey I have embarked on.
